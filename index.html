   Penguins are seabirds in the family Spheniscidae. 
                        <br>
 They use their wings to travel underwater, but they cannot travel in the air.
                        <br>
  Penguins lay their eggs and raise their babies on land. 
                        <br>
  Penguins live only in the Southern Hemisphere of the world: Antarctica, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and South America.
