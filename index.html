  <p> With your coming, only your thoughts come in my life day and night.
From waking up in the morning to sleeping at night, I remember you.
</p>
<br>
  <p> If I don't see you or talk to you for a day, that day doesn't feel like a day
</p>
<br>
<p> Nowhere is interested except you.</p>
<br>
<p> When I saw you for the first time, my heart started beating differently.</p>
<br>
<p> When i see you, atmosphere turns into love. like an atmosphere saying that yes, she is the queen of your heart.
<br>
<p>You have made my soul come alive, and my heart couldn't stop loving you for a mere moment. You are the sweetest thing in my life, and there is nothing else I would ever love as I love you.
<br>
<p>You are only one in my mind and in my heart. Do you know the effect you have on me? Even in times of stress, I find myself calmer than usual. I always seem to find the lighter side in things and situations. This is so unlike me, the pessimist I used to be. You are the only angel in my heart of heaven.</p>
