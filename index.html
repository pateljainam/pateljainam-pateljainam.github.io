  <p> With your coming, only your thoughts come in my life day and night.
From waking up in the morning to sleeping at night, I remember you.
</p>
<br>
  <p> If I don't see you or talk to you for a day, that day doesn't feel like a day
</p>
<br>
<p> Nowhere is interested except you.</p>
<br>
<p> When I saw you for the first time, my heart started beating differently.</p>
